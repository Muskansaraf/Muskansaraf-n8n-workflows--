ðŸŒ€ n8n Workflows Collection
ðŸ“Œ About This Repo

This repository contains my personal collection of n8n workflows for automation, integration, and data processing.
Each workflow is exported from n8n as a .json file and comes with instructions so you can import it into your own instance.

ðŸš€ How to Use These Workflows

Clone or download this repository.

Open your n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).

Go to Workflows â†’ Import from File.

Select the .json workflow file you want.

Set up required credentials (Slack, GitHub, etc.).

Activate the workflow!
